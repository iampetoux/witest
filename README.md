## FAQ

#### How would you improve your code with more working time?

Firstly, I would add more checks on the requests results. I would also deal with Refresh Tokens.

I would also create separated API routes, one to get access tokens, and one to retrieve the weight.

To make the the results more "web friendy", build a React app to consume the two API routes that we discussed before.
